Project Overview
This project demonstrates a deep learning approach to classifying fruits from images. Using the Fruits-360 dataset, we built a robust image classification model with the power of TensorFlow and Keras.

How to Run the Project
Dataset: Place the fruits.zip file in your Google Drive.

Google Colab: Open the main project notebook in Google Colab.

Mount Drive: Run the cell to mount your Google Drive.

Execute Code: Run the remaining cells sequentially. The notebook will automatically unzip the dataset, train the model, and display the results.
